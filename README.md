### Bootcamp Project

This bootcamp is based on a single and individual class project. You will start
work on this project from Week 1 and will deliver the completed project with
final presentation on Week 6



### Prerequisites

This course requires basic Linux and programming skills. You can complete all
coursework with an editor of your choice. Use the following recommendations to get
up to speed on these skills.

**Linux**
If learners lack basic Linux skills it is recommended to go through this course:

* [Linux and Bash For Data Engineering](https://ds500.paiml.com/learn/course/nyu26)

**GitHub Platform**

Being able to work around and in GitHub is essential. Use these courses to get a refresher on automation, AI, and development environments:

### Week 1: Setup your Development Environment

[Rust Fundamentals: Week 1](https://ds500.paiml.com/course/g6u1k/1)

This week you will start by forking or copying the template repository. This repository is the foundational step for creating your Rust application by the end of this bootcamp. You will also focus on setting up your development environment.

This course uses Visual Studio Code, but you are free to change to use anything else.

* [Fork the template repository](https://github.com/paiml/ds500-rust-project-template)

**Weekly Discussion prompt:** Discuss your text editor choice and setting up the debugger. There are different debuggers available for Rust. Explain your choice.


### Week 2: Project Structure

This week you will think about your project of choice. What will you build? You will start creating the necessary files and structure for your project.

[Rust Fundamentals: Week 2](https://ds500.paiml.com/course/g6u1k/2)


**Weekly Discussion prompt:** Discuss your project idea. What will you build and why?


### Week 3: Data Structures and Advanced Types

[Rust Fundamentals: Week 3](https://ds500.paiml.com/course/g6u1k/3)


This week you will dive into Rust's powerful data structures including structs, strings, vectors, and enums. You'll learn how to define custom types, manipulate collections, and work with Rust's unique approach to data organization. Focus on implementing these concepts in your project by creating the core data structures you'll need.

I recommend this video for dealing with exhaustive matches:

* [Week 3, Lesson 3: Exhaustive Matches](https://ds500.paiml.com/course/g6u1k/3/3/7)

**Weekly Demo video prompt:** Share the structs and enums you've designed for your project. How do they model your problem domain, and what challenges did you encounter with ownership and borrowing?

### Week 4: Building Libraries and Testing

[Rust Fundamentals: Week 4](https://ds500.paiml.com/course/g6u1k/4)

This week focuses on professional Rust development practices. You'll learn to create libraries with Cargo, write comprehensive documentation, organize your code with modules, and implement thorough testing strategies. Apply test-driven development principles to your project and ensure your code is well-documented and maintainable.

Organiznig test files can be challenging if you are not used to how this happens in Rust. This is my recommended video for this week:

* [Week 4, Lesson 3: Organizing test files](https://ds500.paiml.com/course/g6u1k/4/3/2)

**Weekly Demo video prompt:** Discuss your testing strategy for your project. What types of tests are you writing (unit, integration, doc tests) and how are you organizing your test files? Share any interesting edge cases you discovered.

### Week 5: Command Line Applications and Best Practices

[Rust Fundamentals: Week 5](https://ds500.paiml.com/course/g6u1k/5)

In the final week, you'll complete your Rust project by building a command-line interface. You'll learn to handle user input, manage command-line arguments, implement proper error handling, and follow Rust CLI best practices. This is where you bring everything together into a polished, working application.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You will have an extra buffer week to extend or complete your project. The extra week will have no video attached to it.

**Weekly Demo video prompt:** Present your completed project! Share your CLI application, discuss the challenges you overcame, and reflect on your Rust learning journey. What would you build next with Rust?

### Week 6: Final Presentations

This week is a _buffer_ week. Use it for adding and completing final details on your project and come into the Discord channel with any last questions.

Also, **congratulations**! Completing this bootcamp is something to celebrate, and we are happy you made it to the end. Good job!

### Assignment Overview and Feedback Breakdown

Grading and feedback turnaround will be one week from the due date. You will be notified if the turnaround will be longer than one week.

The discussion forums, written assignments, demo videos, and final project will be graded based on specific criteria or a rubric. The criteria or rubric for each type of assessment will be available in the course.


#### Late Work Policy

This bootcamp is meant for learners to be fully accountable and responsible for their work. At the end of the bootcamp, your project is your accomplishment. There is no specific grading or tests. The artifact you produce is the validation of completion of this bootcamp and its contents.

### Online Communication and Interaction Expectations

#### Discussion Forums

The purpose of the discussion boards is to allow learners to freely exchange ideas. It is imperative to remain respectful of all viewpoints and positions and, when necessary, agree to respectfully disagree. While active and frequent participation is encouraged, cluttering a discussion board with inappropriate, irrelevant, or insignificant material will not earn additional points and may result in receiving less than full credit. Frequency matters, but contributing content that adds value is paramount. Please remember to cite all sources—when relevant—in order to avoid plagiarism. Please post your viewpoints first and then discuss others’ viewpoints.

The quality of your posts and how others view and respond to them are the most valued. A single statement mostly implying “I agree” or “I do not agree” is not counted as a post. Explain, clarify, politely ask for details, provide details, persuade, and enrich communications for a great discussion experience. Please note, there is a requirement to respond to at least two fellow class members’ posts. Also, remember to cite all sources—when relevant—in order to avoid plagiarism.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> Failure to meet minimum standards of online communication might get your access revoked

#### Online Communication Etiquette

Beyond interacting with your instructor and peers in discussions, you will be expected to communicate primarily by Discords messages, and in the weekly sync sessions.

Just as you expect a response when you send a message to your instructor, please respond promptly when your instructor contacts you. Your instructor will expect a response within two business days. This will require that you log into the course site regularly and set up your notifications to inform you when the instructor posts an announcement, provides feedback on work or sends you a message.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Failure to meet minimum standards of online communication might get your access revoked

#### Participation and Attendance

This bootcamp will meet at a particular day and time each week. Attendance is not mandatory and is meant to discuss project progress, prodivde feedback, and do general Q&A. Your attendance does not affect your bootcamp completion.


### Course Technology

This course will involve a number of different types of interactions. These interactions will take place primarily through Discord and Zoom for weekly check-ins and willl use the [Pragmatic AI Labs](https://ds500.paiml.com/) platform for video content. Please take the time to navigate through the course and become familiar with the course syllabus, structure, and content and review the list of resources.
