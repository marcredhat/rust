# Rubric for the Bootcamp

This document outlines the rubric used for this bootcamp.

## 6 weekly deliveries

Look at the requirements for the final individual project and create a week by
week schedule for the next weeks with specific milestones.

For each week, create a weekly demo. You will follow the discussion prompt and present on the Discord channel.

Watch the included lessons as you make progress and make use of the weekly syncs.

* Full project delivery on GitHub (100%)
    * A project that reflects sound engineering best-practices and follows feedback from teachers.


## Final project delivery

You will deliver a project based on Rust. These are the requirements
for the project:

1. Has to be very well documented with a `README.md` that explains what the main
   purpose of the application is, how to set it up, and run it.
1. The documentation needs to have workable examples of the application.
1. It needs to have tests


Bonus:

1. The project should have automation with GitHub Actions that can ensure linting and testing pass on every push to the main branch.
